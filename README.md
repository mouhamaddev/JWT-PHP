# Simple JWT Implementation in PHP

This is a simple implementation of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in PHP, created manually for learning purposes. It's essential to note that while this implementation works, it is not considered the best practice for handling JWT in a real-world application. It's highly recommended to use official JWT libraries for PHP, such as `firebase/php-jwt`, for production-ready code.
